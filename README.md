## What the project does -
   Scene allows one to view nearby deals that are crowdsourced.
***

   ## Why the project is useful -

   Users will see deals that are nearby that they otherwise would have missed, and it is a medium for businesses to use to attract nearby patrons, who would not have known about daily deals.

**How users can get started with the project -**
  - Scroll through the feed to view deals in Austin, Texas. Add a new deal to the feed.

**Primary Technologies Used -**
- Foursquare API was used to search for nearby businesses that if the user would like to visit another business.
- Google Maps API is used to give the user walking directions to the deal and Google Maps URLs are generated for the business addresses to provide more robust directions.
- Moment.js was used to convert the user input so that deals can expire and be removed from the database.
- Firebase is used to store and populate user posts. 
- Bootstrap and Animate.css were used to style our program.
