git hub source code: https://github.com/ericjosprice/Project-1-Scene.git

What the project does -
   Scene allows one to view nearby deals that are crowdsourced.
Why the project is useful -
   Users will see deals that are nearby that they otherwise would have missed, and it is a medium for businesses to use to attract nearby patrons, who otherwise would not have known about daily deals.
How users can get started with the project -
   Scroll through the feed to view deals in Austin, Texas. Add a new deal to the feed.
Primary Technologies Used -
Foursquare API was used to search for nearby businesses that if the user would like to visit another business.
Google Maps API is used to give the user walking directions to the deal and Google Maps URLs are generated for the business addresses to provide more robust directions.
Moment.js was used to convert the user input so that deals can expire and be removed from the database.
Firebase is used to store and populate user posts. 
Bootstrap and Animate.css were used to style our program.
